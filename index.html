    <h2>More About Electroquake</h2>
    <p>The electricity running beneath the buildings plays a crucial role in maintaining structural contact and alignment after an earthquake. In traditional designs, buildings are often treated as independent structures that must individually absorb and resist seismic forces. Our model introduces a different approach—using a shared underground electrical network to link buildings together. This network allows for synchronized behavior during and after seismic activity, helping to reduce the risk of structural drift or separation.</p>

    <p>The concept is rooted in the idea of smart, interconnected infrastructure. The electrical system beneath the buildings does more than just transmit power; it acts as a stabilizing force that maintains cohesion between structures. When seismic waves hit, this network helps redistribute energy across the connected buildings, allowing them to move in harmony instead of independently. This unity reduces stress on individual buildings and increases the overall stability of the system, especially in clustered urban environments.</p>

    <p>Our inspiration comes from iconic structures like the Burj Khalifa, which employs a highly advanced structural design to resist earthquakes and high winds. While the Burj Khalifa doesn’t rely on an underground electrical system for seismic safety, it does utilize central cores, deep foundations, and distributed structural systems to maintain integrity. We drew from that philosophy and imagined how a network of buildings—not just a single tower—could benefit from a shared, energy-based system for earthquake protection.</p>

    <p>This interconnected electrical design also opens the door to future smart city integration. With real-time sensors and feedback mechanisms tied into the electrical grid, buildings can respond intelligently to seismic activity. The system could trigger coordinated safety protocols, emergency lighting, and even dynamic structural adjustments, all powered and communicated through the same network. It’s a step toward creating earthquake-resilient zones, not just resilient buildings.</p>

    <p>In summary, our earthquake protection model uses electricity in a groundbreaking way—literally and conceptually—to unify buildings and create a safer urban environment. By ensuring that structures remain connected through a shared electrical base, we aim to reduce isolation-based damage and promote synchronized, intelligent response during natural disasters. It’s a futuristic concept, but one that builds on real-world engineering principles seen in landmark designs like the Burj Khalifa.</p>
